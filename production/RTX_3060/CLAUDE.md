**Purpose:** Real-time restaurant surveillance system using computer vision to monitor table states and staff coverage across multiple camera feeds.

## Quick Start - New Deployment

### **Option 1: Automated Startup (Recommended for Production)**

```bash
cd /path/to/production/RTX_3060

# Use robust shell wrapper with auto-restart
./start.sh                  # Start service (background with auto-restart)
./start.sh --foreground     # Run in foreground (debug mode)
./start.sh --status         # Check service status
./start.sh --stop           # Stop service
./start.sh --logs           # View logs
```

**Features:**
- Auto-restart on crash
- Pre-flight checks (database, models, disk space)
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Comprehensive logging

### **Option 2: Systemd Service (Permanent Deployment)**

```bash
cd scripts/deployment
sudo ./install_service.sh

# Service commands
sudo systemctl start ase_surveillance
sudo systemctl stop ase_surveillance
sudo systemctl status ase_surveillance
sudo systemctl enable ase_surveillance  # Auto-start on boot
```

**Features:**
- OS-level daemon protection
- Auto-start on boot
- Restart on failure
- Integrated with system journal

### **Option 3: Python Direct (Development/Testing)**

```bash

## Production Optimizations (v3.0)

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-14

Four critical optimizations implemented for production RTX 3060 deployment:

### 1. Dynamic GPU Worker Scaling (orchestration/process_videos_orchestrator.py v3.0.0)

**Problem:** Fixed 4-worker approach wasted GPU resources or caused thermal issues.

**Solution:** Research-based dynamic scaling using pynvml (nvidia-ml-py3)
- **Start conservative:** 1 worker (not 4)
- **Scale intelligently:** Based on temperature, utilization, and memory
- **RTX 3060 safe range:** 65-80°C optimal, 83-85°C throttle, 93°C max
- **Scale up conditions (ALL must pass):**
  - Temperature < 70°C
  - GPU utilization < 70%
  - Free memory > 2GB
  - 60-second cooldown elapsed
- **Scale down conditions (ANY triggers):**
  - Temperature > 75°C
  - GPU utilization > 85%
  - Free memory < 1GB
- **Emergency shutdown:** Temperature >= 80°C (2-minute cooldown)

**Result:** Adaptive 1-8 worker pool maximizes throughput while preventing thermal damage.

### 2. FPS-Based Network Reconnection (video_capture/capture_rtsp_streams.py v3.0.0)

**Problem:** 30-second reconnection delay could miss critical state changes (customer leaving, table transitions).

**Solution:** Immediate segmentation based on frame rate monitoring
- **Monitor FPS continuously:** Sliding window of 20 frames
- **Detect disconnect:** FPS < 2 (not time-based delay)
- **Immediate action:** Save current file, create new segment instantly
- **No gaps:** Continuous coverage even during network issues
- **Faster reconnection:** 10-second retry interval (vs 30s)
- **Coverage tracking:** Log all gaps and resumptions

**Result:** Zero missed state changes during network instability.

### 3. First-Second Preprocessing (video_processing/table_and_region_state_detection.py v3.0.0)

**Problem:** 1-second debounce requirement meant initial states couldn't be established immediately.

**Solution:** Pause at first frame to establish baseline
- **Read first frame:** Capture initial scene state
- **Run detection:** Process frame through both detection stages
- **Initialize states:** Set all table and division states based on first frame
- **Wait 1 second:** Fill debounce buffer before playback
- **Resume playback:** Start normal frame-by-frame processing

**Result:** All ROIs have valid states from frame 0, preventing false transitions.

### 4. Intelligent Disk Monitoring (monitoring/check_disk_space.py v2.0.0)

**Problem:** Reactive 2-hour checks couldn't predict running out of space mid-day.

**Solution:** Predictive monitoring with usage speed calculation
- **Measure speed:** Observe disk usage for 30 seconds
- **Calculate rate:** GB/hour during recording window
- **Query recording:** Remaining hours until end of capture window (2 PM or 10 PM)
- **Predict need:** Rate × Remaining hours + 20% safety margin
- **Proactive cleanup:** Free space BEFORE shortage occurs
- **Hourly checks:** Changed from 2-hour to 1-hour cron interval

**Key Features:**
- Detects active recording processes (`capture_rtsp_streams`)
- Only measures speed during recording hours (11:30 AM - 2 PM, 5 PM - 10 PM)
- Three-tier status: SAFE (margin) / TIGHT (sufficient) / CRITICAL (shortage)
- Automatic proactive cleanup based on predictions

**Result:** No mid-day storage failures, proactive space management.

## System Monitoring

### monitoring/
Real-time system health monitoring and management.

**Scripts:**
- `check_disk_space.py` v2.0.0 - **Intelligent** disk space monitoring with predictive analytics
- `monitor_gpu.py` - GPU temperature and utilization tracking
- `system_health.py` - Comprehensive health check

**Key Features (v2.0.0):**
- **Intelligent Prediction**: Measures disk usage speed, predicts space needs
- **Proactive Cleanup**: Frees space BEFORE running out (not reactive)
- **Smart Cleanup**: Automatically deletes oldest videos when needed
- **Protected Dates**: Always keeps today + yesterday (for processing)
- **Critical Alerts**: Warns if can't store remaining day of videos
- **GPU Monitoring**: Real-time temperature and utilization
- **Exit Codes**: 0=healthy, 1=warning, 2=critical

**Usage (v2.0.0):**
```bash
# Check disk space with predictions (default)
python3 monitoring/check_disk_space.py --check

# Show detailed predictions
python3 monitoring/check_disk_space.py --predict

# Auto-cleanup with predictive target
python3 monitoring/check_disk_space.py --cleanup

# Dry run (test without deleting)
python3 monitoring/check_disk_space.py --cleanup --dry-run

# Disable predictions (use basic check only)
python3 monitoring/check_disk_space.py --check --no-prediction

# Monitor GPU
python3 monitoring/monitor_gpu.py

# Watch GPU continuously
python3 monitoring/monitor_gpu.py --watch 30

# Full health check
python3 monitoring/system_health.py
```

**Intelligent Prediction Logic (v2.0.0):**
1. Check if recording is active (pgrep capture_rtsp_streams)
2. Calculate remaining recording hours (until 9 PM)
3. Measure disk usage speed (observe 30 seconds)
4. Calculate: Rate (GB/hour) × Remaining hours = Predicted usage
5. Add 20% safety margin
6. Compare predicted free space vs current
7. Proactive cleanup if prediction shows future shortage

**Smart Cleanup Logic (v2.0.0):**

Three-phase intelligent cleanup with different retention policies:

**Phase 1: Screenshot Cleanup**
- Retention: 30 days
- Location: `db/screenshots/`
- Logic: Delete screenshots older than 30 days
- Always runs (independent of disk space)

**Phase 2: Raw Video Cleanup (Intelligent)**
- Retention: Max 2 days (or delete when processed)
- Location: `videos/YYYYMMDD/camera_XX/`
- Logic:
  - **Today (age=0)**: Always keep (currently recording)
  - **≥1 day + processed**: Delete (has results in `results/`)
  - **>2 days**: Delete unconditionally (max retention limit)
- Smart detection: Checks if `results/YYYYMMDD/camera_XX/*.mp4` exists
- Result: Raw videos deleted as soon as processed, freeing space faster

**Phase 3: Processed Video Cleanup**
- Retention: 2 days
- Location: `results/YYYYMMDD/`
- Logic: Delete folders older than 2 days
- Simple age-based cleanup

**Phase 4: Database (Permanent Storage)**
- Retention: ♾️ **Permanent** (never deleted)
- Location: `db/detection_data.db`
- Contains all state change history for business analytics

**Cleanup Priority:**
1. Screenshots (30 days) → Free up screenshot storage
2. Raw videos (intelligent) → Free up largest storage (raw footage)
3. Processed videos (2 days) → Free up processed results
4. Database → **Never deleted** (permanent business data)

**Automated Monitoring:**
Disk space check runs **hourly** via cron (see `deployment/install_cron_jobs.sh`)
- **Changed from 2-hour to 1-hour intervals for better prediction accuracy**
- Automatically triggers cleanup when space < 100GB or prediction shows shortage

## Configuration Files

**Location:** All configuration files are stored in `scripts/config/`

### config/table_region_config.json
**Structure:**
```json
{
  "division": [[x1,y1], [x2,y2], ...],
  "tables": [
    {
      "id": "T1",
      "polygon": [[x1,y1], ...],
      "sitting_area_ids": ["SA1", "SA2"]
    }
  ],
  "sitting_areas": [
    {
      "id": "SA1",
      "polygon": [[x1,y1], ...],
      "table_id": "T1"
    }
  ],
  "service_areas": [
    {
      "id": "SV1",
      "polygon": [[x1,y1], ...]
    }
  ],
  "frame_size": [1920, 1080],
  "video": "../videos/camera_35.mp4"
}
```

**Current Setup:** 5 tables, 10 sitting areas, 2 service areas (1920x1080)

## ROI Hierarchy and Logic

### Region Priority (Assignment Order)
1. **Tables** - Individual table surfaces
2. **Sitting Areas** - Chairs/seating (linked to tables)
3. **Service Areas** - Bar, POS, prep stations
4. **Walking Areas** - Implicit (remaining division area)

### Table State Logic
```
IDLE (Green):     customers=0 AND waiters=0
BUSY (Yellow):    customers>0 AND waiters=0
CLEANING (Blue):  waiters>0 (any count)
```

### Division State Logic
```
RED (Understaffed): service_waiters=0 AND walking_waiters=0
YELLOW (Busy):      service_waiters>0 (staff at service area)
GREEN (Serving):    walking_waiters>0 (staff in walking area)
```

**Debouncing:** All state transitions require 1.0s stability to prevent flickering.

## Deployment Checklist

**Before deploying to RTX 3060:**
1. ✅ Models present in `models/` directory
2. ✅ Configuration file created (run interactive mode first)
3. ⏳ 10-camera RTSP connections configured
4. ⏳ Cloud upload pipeline (Supabase) setup
5. ⏳ Cron job for automated scheduling
6. ⏳ Error handling and health monitoring
7. ⏳ Disk space monitoring (videos + screenshots + DB)

## Important Warnings

1. **Scripts reorganized into feature directories** - See `scripts/STRUCTURE.md` for navigation
2. **DO NOT modify production scripts directly** - Test in `tests/test-scripts/` first
3. **DO NOT run interactive mode on production videos** - Use pre-created configs
4. **Monitor disk space** - H.264 videos + screenshots + DB can grow quickly
5. **Database grows infinitely** - Implement rotation/cleanup policy
6. **Screenshot directory grows** - Consider cleanup after video upload
7. **GPU memory leak risk** - Monitor long-running processes
8. **RTSP connection stability** - Handle reconnection gracefully

## Recent Improvements (2025-11-16)

### 1. Camera Credential Collection
**File:** `scripts/deployment/initialize_restaurant.py` v1.1.0

**Problem:** Initial deployment script did not ask for camera usernames and passwords.

**Solution:** Added prompts for each camera:
- Username (default: admin)
- Password (default: 123456)
- Port (default: 554)
- Stream path (default: /media/video1)

**Impact:** Proper RTSP authentication configuration during initial setup.

### 2. Camera Management Tool
**File:** `scripts/deployment/manage_cameras.py` (new)

**Problem:** No way to add/remove/edit cameras after initial deployment.

**Solution:** Created interactive management tool with full CRUD operations for cameras.

**Impact:** Flexible camera configuration throughout system lifecycle.

### 3. Robust Startup System
**Files:** `start.sh` (new), `scripts/deployment/ase_surveillance.service` (existing)

**Problem:** Need daemon-level protection with auto-restart and crash recovery.

**Solution:** Two-layer protection system:
- **Layer 1:** Shell script wrapper (`start.sh`) with infinite loop auto-restart
- **Layer 2:** Systemd service with `Restart=on-failure`

**Features:**
- Auto-restart on crash (10-second delay)
- Pre-flight checks (database, models, disk space, network)
- Graceful shutdown (SIGTERM → 30s wait → SIGKILL)
- PID file management (prevents duplicate instances)
- Comprehensive logging to `logs/startup.log`
- Foreground/background modes

**Impact:** Production-grade reliability with automatic crash recovery and system-level daemon protection.
